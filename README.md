Overview:[FindMe is an interactive app designed to bridge the gap between recruiters and college students from underrepresented backgrounds, lesser-known schools, and diverse genders. The app aims to provide these students with access to internships, fellowships, and externships that they might not be aware of. Unlike typical professional networking platforms, FindMe uses an innovative matching system to connect recruiters and students based on their profiles, ensuring more personalized and effective interactions.]

Category:[Social Networking]

Story:[FindMe allows students to create detailed profiles highlighting their skills, experiences, and career interests. Recruiters can create profiles showcasing their companies, available positions, and desired candidate qualifications. The app's matching algorithm then suggests potential matches, facilitating direct communication between students and recruiters. This process helps students discover opportunities they might not have found on their own and enables recruiters to tap into a diverse talent pool.]

Market:[FindMe targets college students from underrepresented backgrounds and lesser-known schools, as well as recruiters looking to diversify their talent pools.]

Habit:[Users are likely to use the app regularly, especially during recruitment seasons. Students will frequently check for new opportunities and interactions with recruiters, while recruiters will use the app to discover and connect with potential candidates.]

Scope:[Initially, FindMe will focus on providing a platform for profile creation, matching, and messaging between students and recruiters. The scope will include functionalities like login, account creation, profile management, and basic communication features. Advanced features like real-time notifications and multimedia content sharing may be considered in future updates.]
